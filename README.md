# Coder Devcontainers w/ Envbuilder

The following repository hosts an example devcontainers spec. If you don't know what are devcontainers, take a look at [Microsoft's documentation](https://containers.dev/overview) and [Coder's](https://coder.com/docs/admin/templates/managing-templates/devcontainers). If you don't know Envbuilder, check out [Coder's Github](https://github.com/coder/envbuilder/blob/main/README.md).

Envbuilder doesn't have 100% feature parity w/ Microsoft's Devcontainers. Refer to this [list of available features](https://github.com/coder/envbuilder/blob/main/docs/devcontainer-spec-support.md).

For a very simple example, reference Coder's [envbuilder-starter-container](https://github.com/coder/envbuilder-starter-devcontainer).

If you need to integrate new features into your devcontainer spec, reference this [list](https://containers.dev/features).
